# Background Removal Tool

This is repository contains the model deployment of the project - [Background Removal using Semantic Segmentation](https://github.com/umar07/Background_Removal_Semantic_Segmentation). A pre-trained deep learning model is used to remove background of portrait images that contain humans in real-time. You can also download the resultant image.

The web-app was made using the **Streamlit** library, which offers very simple and interactive solutions in python for quick deployment of web-apps.
